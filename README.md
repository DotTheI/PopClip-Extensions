Please note -- the structure of this repo is changing. It is no longer the only repo which can provide extensions to the directory. The directory backend now accepts extensions from multiple repositories. So this is now just one of many extension repos.

The repo has a large build up of over a decade of cruft which I am trying to tame down bit by bit!

Extension signing is now handled automatically on the server and the files in `extensions/` have been removed. An archive of previous signed & published `.popclipext` files can be found in the `archive` branch:
<https://github.com/pilotmoon/PopClip-Extensions/tree/archive/extensions>

# PopClip Extensions

This repository contains the source files for my extensions published in the official [PopClip Extensions Directory](https://www.popclip.app/extensions/).

### License

All extension source files are published under the MIT License (see [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt)) unless noted otherwise in the readme files of individual extensions.

### Credits

All the extensions and documentation were created by Nick Moore, except where stated. Individual extension credits are included in a readme file with the extension.

### Repository Layout

The important folders:

- `source` - sources for the published extensions (maintained and supported by me)
- `source-contrib` - folder for user-submitted and experimental extensions (for archive/reference only -- no longer maintained)

### Contributing

Bug fixes and updates to existing extensions are welcome via pull request.

Your own extensions should not be contributed to this repo, but instead you may submit them to the extensions directory directly from your own repository. As this is a new feature, I am onboarding contributors on an indiviual basis. Please contact Nick via <mailto:support@pilotmoon.com> for instructions.
