# PopClip Extensions

> [!INFO]
> Visit the [*PopClip Forum*](https://forum.popclip.app/) to keep up-to date about extensions development, to ask questions, and to help others.

This repository contains the source files for the extensions published on the official [PopClip Extensions](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/extensions) page.

### License

All extension source files are published under the MIT License (see [LICENSE.txt](/LICENSE.txt)) unless noted otherwise in the readme files of individual extensions.

### Credits

All the extensions and documentation were created by Nick Moore, except where stated. Individual extension credits are included in a readme file with the extension.

### Repository Layout & Contributing

The important folders:

- `source` - sources for the published extensions (maintained and supported by me)
- `source-contrib` - folder for user-submitted and experimental extensions
- `extensions` - signed and zipped `.popclipextz` files built from the `source` and `source-contrib` folders

Bugfixes ~~and new extension submissions~~ are welcome via pull request. Please note the following:

**The repo is currently closed for new extension contributions. I am working on a new, improved extension directory. Please bear with me!**

- ~~New extensions should be submitted as source files in a `.popclipext` folder inside the `source-contrib` folder.~~
- ~~Please do not submit any zipped `.popclipextz` files.~~
- ~~By contributing to this repo, you agree that your contribution may be published at [PopClip Extensions](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/extensions/).~~
- ~~Submitting an extension does not guarantee publication on the website.~~
- ~~I may make changes to any extension submitted.~~
