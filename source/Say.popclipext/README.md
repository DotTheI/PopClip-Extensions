# Say

PopClip extension to speak the text aloud using the Mac's built-in text-to-speech.

The extension simply invokes the `say` command-line tool, which is included with macOS.

The text is spoken using the default voice settings, which can be changed in System Settings → Accessibility → Spoken Content.
