# RunCommand

Run Terminal Command extension for PopClip.

Runs the selected text as a command in the current Terminal window.

One can choose either Terminal, iTerm2 or Warp Terminal.

2 Jun 2015: Separated the two sides into separate actions. Having both apps referenced in one script was causing problems.

19 Feb 2016: Added third config option to support iTerm2 v2.9 and above, which has breaking AppleScript changes.

28 Mar 2024: Removed the legacy iTerm option and added Warp Terminal.
