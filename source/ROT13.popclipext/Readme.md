# ROT13

Apply the ROT13 cipher to the selected text.

ROT13 is used in online forums as a means of hiding spoilers, punchlines, puzzle solutions, and offensive materials from the casual glance.

As [cryptii.com](https://cryptii.com/pipes/rot13-decoder) puts it:

> ROT13 (rotate by 13 places) replaces a letter with the letter 13 letters after it in the alphabet. It has been described as the "Usenet equivalent printing an answer to a quiz upside down" as it provides virtually no cryptographic security.
