# DeepL Translator

Translate the text with [DeepL Translator](https://www.deepl.com/translator).

Download: [DeepLTranslator.popclipextz](https://github.com/pilotmoon/PopClip-Extensions/raw/master/extensions/DeepLTranslator.popclipextz)

## Description

The extension has a single action that takes text as input and sends it either to the DeepL website, or the DeepL app.

When using the App mode, the DeepL app must be already running and the "DeepL App Shortcut" setting must be set to match the shortcut in DeepL preferences.

### Options

* **Mode**: Chose whether to perform the translation in a browser on the DeepL website, or in the DeepL app.
* **DeepL App Shortcut**: Sets the key combo for PopClip to use to activate DeepL. Leave this blank to use the default DeepL combo which is "âŒ˜+C+C". Otherwise type a key combo like "control option command D". (See [Key Combo String Format](https://github.com/pilotmoon/PopClip-Extensions#key-combo-string-format).)
* **Website Output Language**: Chose the output language for website mode. (Input language will auto-detect.)
